# machineLearningAPI
In this project, you will apply some skills to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. We are given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on.
