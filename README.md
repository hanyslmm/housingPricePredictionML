# machineLearningAPI
In this project, you will apply some skills to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. We are given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on.

## Tasks
  1. Test project code using linting
  1. Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
  1. Deploy containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
  1. Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
  1. Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
  1. Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
  1. Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that code has been tested successfully
